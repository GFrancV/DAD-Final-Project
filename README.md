## Overview

This is a full stack mono repo web application which is a kind of virtual bank that allows you to create virtual cards to manage your finances. The project is divided into two repositories, the frontend made in Vue and the backend made in Laravel. This application was developed as a final project for the DaD subject.

## Frontend

The frontend was developed using Vue.js, a JavaScript framework for building user interfaces and single-page applications. The frontend is responsible for the user interface and the user experience of the application.

To see more for the frontend repository, click [here](./client/README.md).

## Backend

The backend was developed using Laravel, a PHP framework for web applications. In this case Laravel is used to create a Rest API that serves the content to the frontend. The backend is responsible for the business logic and the data persistence of the application.

To see more for the backend repository, click [here](./server/README.md).
